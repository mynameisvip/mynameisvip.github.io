      <description>Welcome! My name is Vas István Péter but my friends call me VIP. I&amp;rsquo;m a Cloud Engineer with several years of experience both in development and operations. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working with AWS, Terraform, and Ansible. On my roadmap, I have Go and Rust. In my free time I travel (this introduction was written in Cancún, Mexico), do yoga, meditate and when I&amp;rsquo;m home I ride my bike. You can easily find me at meetups and conferences about Cloud and DevOps.</description>

      <description>When I purchased a Xiaomi Air Purifier (4 Lite) my first idea was to check if I can set alarms for certain AIQ values. After some research the short answer was no, however I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up so easily. So I went down the rabbit hole to find a solution for crearting an alarm and in the end I came up with a solution which got other featutes. This series of blog post will be about the journey.</description>
